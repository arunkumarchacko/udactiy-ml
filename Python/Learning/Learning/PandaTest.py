The following code is to help you play with the concept of Series in Pandas.

You can think of Series as an one-dimensional object that is similar to
an array, list, or column in a database. By default, it will assign an
index label to each item in the Series ranging from 0 to N, where N is
the number of items in the Series minus one.

Please feel free to play around with the concept of Series and see what it does

'''
# Change False to True to create a Series object
if True:
    series = pd.Series(['Dave', 'Cheng-Han', 'Udacity', 42, -1789710578])
    print series

'''
You can also manually assign indices to the items in the Series when
creating the series
'''

# Change False to True to see custom index in action
if True:
    series = pd.Series(['Dave', 'Cheng-Han', 359, 9001],
                       index=['Instructor', 'Curriculum Manager',
                              'Course Number', 'Power Level'])
    print series

'''
You can use index to select specific items from the Series
'''
# Change False to True to see Series indexing in action
if True:
    series = pd.Series(['Dave', 'Cheng-Han', 359, 9001],
                       index=['Instructor', 'Curriculum Manager',
                              'Course Number', 'Power Level'])
    print series['Instructor']
    print ""
    print series[['Instructor', 'Curriculum Manager', 'Course Number']]

'''
You can also use boolean operators to select specific items from the Series
'''
# Change False to True to see boolean indexing in action
if True:
    cuteness = pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], index=['Cockroach', 'Fish', 'Mini Pig',
                                                 'Puppy', 'Kitten'])
    print cuteness > 3
    print ""
    print cuteness[cuteness > 3]

The following code is to help you play with the concept of Dataframe in Pandas.

You can think of a Dataframe as something with rows and columns. It is
similar to a spreadsheet, a database table, or R's data.frame object.

'''
To create a dataframe, you can pass a dictionary of lists to the Dataframe
constructor:
1) The key of the dictionary will be the column name
2) The associating list will be the values within that column.
'''
# Change False to True to see Dataframes in action
if True:
    data = {'year': [2010, 2011, 2012, 2011, 2012, 2010, 2011, 2012],
            'team': ['Bears', 'Bears', 'Bears', 'Packers', 'Packers', 'Lions',
                     'Lions', 'Lions'],
            'wins': [11, 8, 10, 15, 11, 6, 10, 4],
            'losses': [5, 8, 6, 1, 5, 10, 6, 12]}
    football = pd.DataFrame(data)
    print football

'''
Pandas also has various functions that will help you understand some basic
information about your data frame. Some of these functions are:
1) dtypes: to get the datatype for each column
2) describe: useful for seeing basic statistics of the dataframe's numerical
   columns
3) head: displays the first five rows of the dataset
4) tail: displays the last five rows of the dataset
'''
# Change False to True to see these functions in action
if True:
    data = {'year': [2010, 2011, 2012, 2011, 2012, 2010, 2011, 2012],
            'team': ['Bears', 'Bears', 'Bears', 'Packers', 'Packers', 'Lions',
                     'Lions', 'Lions'],
            'wins': [11, 8, 10, 15, 11, 6, 10, 4],
            'losses': [5, 8, 6, 1, 5, 10, 6, 12]}
    football = pd.DataFrame(data)
    print football.dtypes
    print ""
    print football.describe()
    print ""
    print football.head()
    print ""
    print football.tail()




'''
You can think of a DataFrame as a group of Series that share an index.
This makes it easy to select specific columns that you want from the 
DataFrame. 

Also a couple pointers:
1) Selecting a single column from the DataFrame will return a Series
2) Selecting multiple columns from the DataFrame will return a DataFrame

    print ''
    print football.year  # shorthand for football['year']
    print ''
    print football[['year', 'wins', 'losses']]

'''
Row selection can be done through multiple ways.

Some of the basic and common methods are:
   1) Slicing
   2) An individual index (through the functions iloc or loc)
   3) Boolean indexing

You can also combine multiple selection requirements through boolean
operators like & (and) or | (or)
